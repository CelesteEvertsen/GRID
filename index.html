            <h2>My new journey as a bootcamp student.</h2>
            <p>
              I began this journey not knowing what to expect. Through intense
              weeks of coding, frustration, and growth, I’ve learned more than I
              imagined. The bootcamp has taught me not just technical skills,
              but also confidence in myself.

            <h3>Thrown Into the Deep End</h3>
            <p>
              My First Day at Bootcamp Nervous and unsure, I walked into the
              bootcamp feeling like an imposter. We dove straight into HTML and
              CSS, and I quickly realized how steep the learning curve would be.
              But even after just one day, I felt a spark—maybe I can actually
              do this.

            <h3>Breaking the Wall</h3>
            <p>
              When JavaScript Finally Clicked. I had spent days feeling lost in
              loops, functions, and error messages. But today, something shifted
              I built a working interactive feature all by myself. It wasn’t
              perfect, but it worked, and that moment of clarity was a huge
              confidence boost. I finally felt like a real coder.

            <h3>The Debugging Spiral</h3>
            <p>
              When I Realized Debugging is Part of the Process. I spent hours
              today trying to fix a bug that seemed impossible to track down.
              Frustrated, I took a break and came back with fresh eyes. After
              some trial and error, I found the issue. It was a simple typo!
              This taught me that debugging is just part of the coding journey,
              and patience is key.

            <h3>From Chaos to Structure</h3>
            <p>
              Learning to Organize My Code. I realized my code was becoming a
              mess. Today, I focused on structuring my projects better using
              comments, breaking down tasks, and keeping things organized. It
              made a huge difference in how I approached coding. I felt more in
              control and less overwhelmed.

            <h3>Finding Flow</h3>
            <p>
              The Joy of Coding When Everything Clicks. Today was one of those
              magical days where everything just flowed. I built a small project
              from start to finish without hitting any major roadblocks. I felt
              like I was in the zone, and it reminded me why I love coding. It’s
              not just about solving problems; it’s also about creating
              something new.

            <h3>Not Just Code</h3>
            <p>
              The Importance of Community and Support. I realized that coding
              isn’t just about the technical skills; it’s also about the people
              you meet along the way. My classmates have become a support
              system, and we help each other through tough challenges. It’s
              comforting to know I’m not alone on this journey.
